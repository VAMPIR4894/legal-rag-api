    "answer": "The case summary of Dewan Syed Aley Rasool Ali Khan vs Altaf Hussain And Others on 13 November, 2013 Rajasthan High Court is as follows:  The petitioner, Dewan Syed Aley Rasool Ali Khan, filed a writ petition (S.B. Civil Misc. Appeal No. 4379/2012) against the respondents, Altaf Hussain and others, seeking a declaration that an application filed under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, can be converted into an application under Section 13 of the same Act.  The High Court of Rajasthan at Jaipur held that the conversion of one application to another does not constitute a new cause of action. The court ruled that the respondents had acquired title to the properties in question through adverse possession and therefore, the petition was barred by the principles of res judicata.",
    "explanation": "According to Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, an application for a divorce can be converted into an application for annulment of marriage. However, under Section 13 of the same Act, only an application for annulment of marriage is allowed. The conversion of one application to another does not constitute a new cause of action and therefore, the respondents' title to the properties was acquired through adverse possession, making the petition barred by res judicata.
